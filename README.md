#  tushar_cse-AI-and-ML-A_AI-STUDY-PLANNER

This project is an AI-based Study Planner designed to help students **automatically generate study plans** and **find relevant educational videos**. It combines both frontend and backend components to deliver a smart planning experience. Users interact with the system by uploading a syllabus file, which is then processed to extract key topics. Based on these topics, a personalized study plan is created along with YouTube video suggestions to support the learning process.
